# AgeDefiner Java Telegram Bot

[The bot](https://t.me/AgeDefinerBot) can calculate time length between two dates (e.g. age or length of experience etc.).
Also, the bot can do arithmetical operations on that lengths.

The bot operates as an interpreter of the specific commands. So it should be interacted using its syntax.

## Bot features and syntax with examples

---

1) User variables can be defined in the following way

The common syntax is:

> -config-alias _VarName_ = _Expression_ -m"_Description_"

where
- ***-config-alias*** - required key word which tells the system to create new variable for the user <br>
- ***VarName*** - the valid name of variable ('a..Z' and digits) <br>
- ***Expression*** - any valid expression. It can contain Age(), Diff() functions or defined user variables.
  And any arithmetic operations with them like: Age() - Diff() + Variable. Here is the definition:
  - expression : factor ( ( '+' | '-' ) factor )*
  - factor     : var | func
  - func       : Age(date) | Diff(date, date)
  - var        : NAME
  - date       : dd.mm.yyyy
- ***-m*** - optional key param, which required ***"Description"*** after it with no spaces. It supposed to describe variable meaning for you <br>

Example:
 
>_-config-alias Neo = Age(02.09.1964) -m"Keanu Reeves age"_ <br>
_-config-alias T800 = Age(30.07.1947) -m"Arnold Schwarzenegger age"_ <br>
_-config-alias aDiff = Diff(02.09.1964, 30.07.1947) -m"Age difference between Arnold and Keanu"_
   
- ***Neo*** - is the variable. Non case-sensitive
- ***Age(02.09.1964)*** - is the function (date format is 'dd.mm.yyyy')
- ***-m"Keanu Reeves age"*** - is the description (optional param, should be in quotes "")

2) Variables and functions are supported as input

````
> Neo

````

````
> aDiff
Arnold Schwarzenegger age:

Age of Keanu Reeves on the Matrix release date:
  34 years 6 months 29 days
````
Available functions: Age(d1) Ð¸ Diff(d2, d1). Age -> Diff(Now(), d1)

3) It could be added or subtracted each other
````
> Diff(11.11.1918, 28.07.1914) + Diff(02.09.1945, 01.09.1939) -m"The length of World Wars"
The length of World Wars
  10 years 3 months 15 days
````

````
> T800 - Neo -m"Age difference between Arnold and Keanu"
Age difference between Arnold and Keanu:
  17 years 1 months 3 days
````

4) Multiline input is available
````
> Neo
> Diff(31.03.1999, 02.09.1964) -m"Age of Keanu Reeves on the Matrix release date"
Keanu Reeves age:
  58 years 1 month 17 days //at the moment of 19.10.2022
Age of Keanu Reeves on the Matrix release date:
  34 years 6 months 29 days
````

5) Additional features

_-config-alias-show Neo_ - Show the key Neo
   
_-config-alias-show_ - Show all keys

_-config-alias-delete aDiff_ - Delete the key aDiff

_-config-alias-delete -all_ - Delete all keys
